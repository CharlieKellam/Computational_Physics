title: "Python recap"
---

A pre-requisite for this course is a basic understanding of Python. 
If you need to recap on the basics, you can use the [Python for Physicists website](https://lucydot.github.io/python_novice/) - this covers all of the pre-requisite knowledge needed.

To self-assess your level of understanding, we recommend using [ChooChoo the Checklist tool](https://lucydot.github.io/Python_Northumbria_2023).
